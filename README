Test/AutoLoader version 0.02
============================

DESCRIPTION

This single-purpose module attempts to eliminate uncaught syntax
errors or other obvious goofs in subroutines that are autosplit, and
hence not looked at by C<perl -c Module.pm>.  Ideally, this module
will become unnecessary as you reach full coverage of those
subroutines in your unit tests.  Until that happy day, however, this
should provide a quick and dirty backstop for embarrassing typos.

Test::AutoLoader is built on Test::Builder, and should interoperate
smoothly with other such modules (e.g. Test::Simple, Test::More).
